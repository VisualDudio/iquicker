# iquicker
Student response/polling system that aims to become a free alternative to iClickers. IQuicker is easier to use for both students and teachers, and eliminates the need for external hardware to do a relatively simple task. Most importantly, this new system would save students and professors a lot of money and time, two things they don't have much of.
