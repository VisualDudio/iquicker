# iQuicker

Student response/polling system that aims to become a free alternative to iClickers. IQuicker is easier to use for both students and teachers, and eliminates the need for external hardware to do a relatively simple task. Most importantly, this new system would save students and professors a lot of money and time, two things they don't have much of.
  * Features
    All the functionality from physical iClickers (90% complete)
    Blackboard integration (0% complete)

## USAGE
  * A professor might use iQuicker to gauge student understanding of the material covered during lecture in a streamlined fashion. Integration with BlackBoard would make the process of grading much simpler.
  
## BUILD/INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
  * All platforms
    * Run pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
    
      Execute the command "python server.py" in a terminal, then navigate to localhost:5000 in your preferred web browser.
